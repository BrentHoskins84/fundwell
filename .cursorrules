# Fundwell Project

## What is Fundwell?

Fundwell is a game day squares fundraiser platform. Organizations create contests (Super Bowl, World Series, etc.), participants claim squares on a 10x10 grid, and managers track payments and announce winners.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage, Realtime)
- Stripe (Subscriptions only - not for square payments)
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- TanStack Query (server state)
- React Hook Form + Zod (forms)
- Resend (email)

## Brand Colors

- Primary: #F97316 (orange-500)
- Secondary: #D97706 (amber-600)
- Accent: #FBBF24 (amber-400)
- Background: #18181B (zinc-900)
- Surface: #27272A (zinc-800)

## Code Patterns

- Server Actions for mutations (not API routes)
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Zod schemas for all validation
- Feature-based folder structure: `src/features/[name]/`
- Supabase RLS for all database security
